# CS-Steamworks
Just a meme program using steamworks, includes basic functionalities, setting rich presence, unlocking achievements, fake invites, etc.

add it to your cheat, or whatever, idc.

Get Steamworks.NET here: https://steamworks.github.io/

in the case the DLLs get deleted from the Steamworks.NET folder, you'll need to download the relative DLLs and place them in the folder, being:
 Steamworks.NET.dll
 CSteamworks.dll
 steam_api.dll or steam_api64.dll

most of the code is commented, so it should be pretty easy to understand what's going on
